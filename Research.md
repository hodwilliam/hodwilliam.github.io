##### Adaptation to climate change and subjective wellbeing 
Using cross-section data from the Harmonized Survey on Households Living Standards
(EHCVM) this study examines the factors that motivate households’ decisions
to adapt to climate change, as well as the impact of adaptation on households’ subjective
wellbeing using a self-reported wellbeing scale from the EHCVM survey.
We estimate endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that
households self-select into adaptation to assess the impact of adaptation choices on
individuals’ perceived quality of life.
