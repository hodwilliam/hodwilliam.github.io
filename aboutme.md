[Current Resume](tt.pdf)  
I am a statistician with a strong academic foundation and many years of professional experience in data analysis, impact evaluation, and socioeconomic research. I hold two master’s degrees—one in Statistics for Evaluation and Prospective and another in Economy, Environment, and Sustainable Development—from the Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France.

My expertise spans conducting impact evaluations, leading data collection projects and designing and managing national accounts. I work as an Economist Statistician at the National Institute of Statistics and Demography, where I contribute to producing national accounts, socio-economic surveys, and environmental statistics. My consultancy roles have included working on diverse projects such as evaluating agricultural, public health interventions, and assessing the socioeconomic impacts of policies.

A proficient user of tools like Python, R, Stata, and SurveyCTO, I specialize in statistical modeling, public policy impact assessment, and data cleaning automation. I am fluent in both French and English, which allows me to work effectively in multilingual and multicultural environments.
With a commitment to leveraging data for impactful policy and decision-making, I combine technical expertise with a passion for sustainable development.
