# Bio
I am an economist-statistician and data expert with interests spanning multiple domains, including impact evaluation, economics and sustainable development, and national accounts. I currently serve at the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INStaD) in Benin, where I contribute to the compilation of national accounts, the production of economy-wide material flow accounts, environmental indicators, and circular economy analysis. With a strong academic background—including two Master's degrees in Statistics and Sustainable Development, as well as advanced training from the Paris School of Economics—I bring deep analytical skills to policy evaluation and development research. I have also led survey projects for national and international institutions, leveraging tools like R, Stata, Python, and KoboCollect to generate actionable insights for evidence-based decision-making. Finally, I am actively involved in training and capacity-building programs aimed at strengthening statistical systems and data literacy.
